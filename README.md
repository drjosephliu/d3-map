# Map Data Across the Globe

Data visualisation project from FreeCodeCamp built using React and D3.

#### User stories:

1. I can see where all Meteorites landed on a world map.

2. I can tell the relative size of the meteorite, just by looking at the way it's represented on the map.

3. I can mouse over the meteorite's data point for additional data.
